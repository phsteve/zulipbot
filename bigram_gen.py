# Leo Franchi (F'12): Ok so, the API call is:

# GET /api/v1/messages

# Leo Franchi (F'12): Arguments:

# Leo Franchi (F'12):
# anchor: Message ID to get messages around
# num_before: Number of messages to fetch before anchor
# num_after: Number of messages to fetch after anchor
# I recommend to examine how it works, you can look at the parameters in the Chrome web inspector for the get_old_messages request that the webapp makes when you scroll to the top of a stream

The previous night Amandine and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"jenna.zeigen@gmail.com\">@Jenna Zeigen (F'12)<\/span> had gone shopping with me to get some nice clothes and they were like \"Alex if you have to buy shoes for whatever reason GET LIGHT BROWN ONES.

But I didn't trust myself to go to a different store and not screw this up, so I ended up buying the ones Jenna and Amandine suggested. So you can guess where this went. Anyway I wander into the HS space and suddenly everyone is staring at me. And then suddenly everyone started applauding, literally applauding. So the night eventually goes fine, except afterwards I end up meeting the person I'm now dating (or whatever our situation is) for the first time, and ... er... fail to go home. So then I end up wearing these shoes for about 48 hours total, and my feet are cut up soooooooooooo bad. So bad that when I go into the HS space the next day I literally tracked blood across the floor.
